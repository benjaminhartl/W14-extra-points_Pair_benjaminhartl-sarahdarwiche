=================================================

A repo containing some code based on exercises in the HFJ book

All that needs to be done to compile BenAndSarah.java is the command 
"javac BenAndSarah.java" 

Then to run the file, just type in
"java BenAndSarah"

It will then give you 4 different options of layouts to view.
"1" for BorderLayout
"2" for FlowLayout
"3" for BoxLayout
"4" for Null Layout

Then to view a different one, the window needs to be closed and the program
needs to be run again.
